title: Superscript
syntax-id: superscript
---

This isn't common, but some Markdown processors allow you to use *superscript* to position one or more characters slightly above the normal line of type. To create a superscript, use one caret symbol (`^`) before and after the characters.

```text
X^2^
```

The rendered output looks like this:

X<sup>2</sup>

Alternatively, if your Markdown application supports [HTML](/basic-syntax/#html), you can use the `sup` HTML tag.

```html
X<sup>2</sup>
```
